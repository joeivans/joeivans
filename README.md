I’m Joe, a software engineer and USMC veteran. My personal pronoun preferences are He/Him.

I started my career as a backend engineer at a place called California Regional Multiple Listing Service, whose core strategy was to become the source-of-truth for real estate data aggregation. I had an excellent experience where I got to meet with data vendors across North America to design, build, and maintain a software system that quickly grew into the largest real estate listing service in the United States.

I enjoyed collaborating on system integration directly with data vendors like:

- Zillow and Redfin in the listing search space
- CoreLogic and Black Knight in the analytics space
- And the realtors who actually have to type their listings into the MLS

My favorite parts in that role were that I got to be part of a legacy system transformation to the cloud at massive scale. I also got to learn about law, data governance, developing data policies and all of the politics involved in getting your company’s product to become the accepted standard.

As a senior engineer, I also got to experience some elasticity in our team. I learned concepts like:

- How to grow the team
- How to continue making good progress when someone leaves the team
- How to provide a safe workplace that facilitates knowledge transfer and refinement

I’m currently looking to combine my skills with an engineering team where there’s room to learn, grow and solve the technology problems of the future.
