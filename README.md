Iâ€™m Joe, a software engineer and USMC veteran.

Every day I solve at least one algorithmic coding challenge to keep my skills sharp. I've started documenting this work since the beginning of 2023 and will continue to do so.
I sometimes add new challenges to the repo and sometimes subsequent attempts. Sometimes I only perform repo maintenance tasks.

If there's anything I can help you with, please let me know!

Thanks for stopping by!
