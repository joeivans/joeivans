Iâ€™m Joe, a freelance software engineer and USMC veteran.

I worked for 6 years as an enterprise software engineer, developing mostly B2B backend web services. When the 2020 pandemic seemed endless, I chose to resign from the enterprise and work freelance to further my own personal growth. I found leaving my favorite role as a Senior Software Engineer very difficult but also very promising.

Every day since then, I've solved at least one algorithmic coding challenge to keep my skills sharp. I've only started documenting this work since the beginning of 2023.
