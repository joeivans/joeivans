Hi, I'm Joe, a Software Engineer highly skilled in enterprise systems design and implementation. I helped design and create the largest real estate Multiple Listing Service in the United States.

My favorite languages are JavaScript and C#.

I'm looking for opportunities to contribute to an open source project.

Feel free to send me a message at any time.
